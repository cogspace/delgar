# History of Delgar

## Eras

Eras are the biggest divisions of time in Delgar's history. They span
hundreds to thousands of years and their beginnings and ends are marked by
massive, world-shaking changes.

## History of Delun (the mainland)

### The Dumecian Era (4100 ~ 10,000)

Before the Araxian Empire rose to power, the tiny city-state of
[Dumecia](Dumecia) was the most dominant force on the face of Delgar, and its
histories of that time are the gold standard for accuracy and precision.

### The Araxian Era (10,000 ~ 11,400)

The Araxian Era refers to the entire reign of the [Araxian
Empire](araxian-empire), from its founding in year 10,000 (when the calendar
was established) to its collapse around year 11,400. While the Araxian Empire
may have come and gone, many of its institutions remain, including its
calendar, so this is how time is marked.

The calendar began with the year 10,000 as this was believed at the time to be
the approximate age of the world.

### The Sundered Era (11,400 ~ present)

The Sundered Era is a period of relative stability following the breakup of
the Araxian Empire. While the world is no longer united under one banner, its
time as the once-great Empire has given it a common language, common cultural
touchstones, and a common system of laws, though the particulars vary from
place to place.

## History of Belgrit

### The Mumbandan Era (??? ~ 500)

The exact span of the Mumbandan Era (the reign of the [Mumbandan
civilization](mumbanda) on the islands that are now
[Belgrit](./Places/Belgrit.md)) is unknown. Arcane investigations have
concluded that the most recent remains of the civilization date to around the
year 500, but it is theorized that the civilization was thousands of years
old by that time.

Modern geological surveys indicate that the islands of Belgrit were much
higher above the water at the time, perhaps high enough to be mountain peaks.
Much of the ruins of Mumbandan civilization have been founde underwater.

The Mumbandan people are named for [Anu Mumbanda](anu-mumbanda), who
discovered them. Their writing remains undeciphered to this day, their
language entirely unknown.

### The Eight Kingdoms Era (9000 ~ 11,000)

Before Belgrit was conquered by the Araxian Empire in 11,000 it was divided
among eight kingdoms, the oldest of which had reigned for about 2,000 years
at the time. This period of is known as the Eight Kingdoms Era in Belgritian
history.

[The Eight Kingdoms](eight-kingdoms) would regain power in 11,340 under the
united banner of [King Belg III][king-belg-3], who restored and refined the
system of shared governance established by his ancestor [King Belg
I][king-belg-1].
