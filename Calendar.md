# Calendar

The Araxian Calendar has been used to mark the passing of days, months,
seasons, and years on Delgar for the last four millenia, since the founding
of the Araxian Empire.

## Days of the Week

The Araxian calendar has an 8-day week, also called an _octave._ The days are
names that should be easy for English speakers to remember, from Suriden at
the beginning of the week (because I'm American) and Sarendy at the end. The
"extra" day, Urnoth, is added in the middle, and given a name that starts
with a U because obviously single-U comes before W.

| Suriden | Moriden | Turien | Urnoth | Wesnoth | Thriden | Friden | Sarendy |
| ------- | ------- | ------ | ------ | ------- | ------- | ------ | ------- |
| 1       | 2       | 3      | 4      | 5       | 6       | 7      | 8       |
| 9       | 10      | 11     | 12     | 13      | 14      | 15     | 16      |
| 17      | 18      | 19     | 20     | 21      | 22      | 23     | 24      |
| 25      | 26      | 27     | 28     | 29      | 30      | 31     | 32      |

Each month has exactly 32 days, which means it has exactly 4 weeks and always
starts on a Suriden and ends on a Sarendy. Because of that, a more
"old-fashioned" way of describing days by week number exists, e.g. "the 3rd
Sarendy of Lamera" instead of "Sarendy, the 24th of Lamera"

Delgarans love the number eight. They use base-eight (octal) math, so pretty
much everything is based on the number eight in some way. Eight copper coins
are worth one silver coin, eight silver are worth one gold, etc. It is
suggested to adopt a more Delgaran style of counting in English to help keep
this straight, as it can get confusing otherwise.

| Term           | Numeric value |
| -------------- | ------------- |
| octave         | 8             |
| dekoctave      | 64 (8^2)      |
| hectoctave     | 512 (8^3)     |
| kiloctave      | 4,096 (8^4)   |
| kilodekoctave  | 32,768 (8^6)  |
| kilohectoctave | 262,144 (8^7) |

## Origin and Reckoning

The Araxian Calendar begins on Suriden, the 1st of Vymera, year 1, normally
written "Suriden, 1 Vymera, 1".
