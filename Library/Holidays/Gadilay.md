# Gadilay (32 Lamera)

Gadilay is the largest harvest time festival on the face of Delgar. It is a
melange of several older traditions which merged together during the Araxian
Era.

> It is a cold, crisp morning on the northern plains of Aij -- precisely the
> kind of morning that heralds the coming of winter and the end of autumn. The
> lightest patches of snow are just starting to linger on the ground. Soon, all
> will be white. But not yet.
>
> It starts the way it always does, with some mysterious piper daring first
> to break the silence while the first rays of the sun are breaking over the
> mountains to the east. The flute-song is soon joined by drums, accordions,
> and more, and in moments, music fills the valley.
>
> For today is Gadilay. True, the tall-folk know it by other names, but
> Gadilay is what halflings call it. Supposedly it once was "Gaddle's Day"
> after Gaddle Briarbrand, the greatest halfling hero ever to walk the world,
> but it's much too old a tradition for that to make much sense. It's fitting,
> though, as sense is the one thing Gadilay isn't about.
>
> As the music swells, revelers burst from their homes dressed in colorful
> costumes made from many tiny scraps of cloth stitched together--every piece
> begged, borrowed, or stolen, by tradition--fluttering like the rainbow leaves
> of autumn or the feathers of prairie birds, both of which are claimed as
> inspiration for this part of the tradition. Some wear only scarves or cloaks
> in the fashion, while others are covered head to toe, barely able to see out
> of their ridiculous garments. They cheer and sing as they flow in converging
> rivulets from their farmhouses and cottages and burrows down into the town
> square.
>
> The square is ready for them, with colorful banners draped from eaves to
> eaves, bubbling pots and sizzling grills and roaring ovens and shrill-voiced
> hawkers doing their level best to see devoured every last scrap of the
> harvest's plenty that won't last the coming winter. Invariably the kegs are
> tapped much too early, and the sober-minded politely look the other way, for
> today is Gadilay, and day-drinking is but the opening salvo of the indulgence
> that is to ensue.
>
> The music and feasting continues throughout the day, On this day, the end
> of autumn, and thus the last breath of Lamera, we celebrate beginnings and
> endings. It is said that friendships begun on Gadilay are blessed to last a
> lifetime, and those who say goodbye are destined to return. To be born or to
> die on Gadilay is a particularly good omen - a sign that you will lead a good
> life, or that you already have.
>
> Happy Gadilay, traveler!
