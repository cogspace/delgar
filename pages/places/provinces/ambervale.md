# Ambervale

Home of the [halflings](../../races/halflings.md), Ambervale is the heart of the Araxian Empire, containing the city of [Rovena](../cities/rovena.md) as well as [Araxia](../cities/araxia.md) itself. Ambervale is known as the breadbasket of Delgar, and is named for the vast fields that stretch between the two mountain ranges that define its boundary.
